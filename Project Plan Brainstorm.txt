Project Plan Brainstorm

What are elements of a good project plan?
-----------------------------------------

- Clear, no ambiguity in what is trying to be accomplished. That is to say, decisions about what needs to be coded/worked on
are not left obscure; What's added to the project is in the plan, and what's in the plan is what's added to the project.
- Baby Steps. The plan outlines tasks in the smallest steps possible, with the intention of making it easy to work on the project.
- The plan only outlines core functionality, and doesn't confuse goals with less important tasks. (e.g. it is not important
that the GUI is colored in an attractive way, is IS important that the GUI has the desired output)
- To be continued.


What things do you need to think about for diving in?
-----------------------------------------------------

- The project plan should include organization of the work to be done, seperating different parts, like GUI and certain 
components, but also how they will connect later on.
- It is invaluable to anticipate problems before they arise. Areas where knowledge is lacking, or there is an unsolved problem, 
need to be outlined at first so that they can be considered before starting the project. The project cannot be started if 
these issues have not been addressed and planned for.
- There should be atleast a paragraph that can sum up the goal, functionality and purpose of the program in the first place. 
This could be a vision statement, or a project description, or the like, to orient the developer to what is it they are making.
No amont of time spent on the project should be spent doddling on different ideas for functionality or questioning the value 
of certain content added.
